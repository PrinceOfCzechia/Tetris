# Tetris
Yet another Tetris game, but this one was made by me. Mostly by searching the internet on how to do it, as one should.

## Sample
It kinda looks like this

and saves a leaderboard which looks like this

In general, everything works just like you would expect from the original game.

## Design
There are three JFramForms in total: WelcomeForm (WF), GameForm (GF) and LeaderboardForm (LF).

The player is introduced to the WF where they have a choice to either start a new game, show their local leaderboard or quit the program.

In the GF, the game is played using arrow keys for block movement and "P" to pause the game. There is also a button where one can pause the game manually and two labels display the current score and level. Once the game is over, the player is asked to enter their name which is subsequently saved in the leaderboard.

In the LF, the leaderboard is displayed. A player can either return to the WF or start a new game, which runs in an instance of GF. The leaderboard is sorted by levels and scores of individual players.

## Functionality
### WelcomeForm.java
This form contains three buttons, which set it invisible and either set visible the GameForm, the LeaderboardForm, or quit the app. Pretty much all the functionality is autogenerated by netbeans.

### LeaderboardForm.java
Here, the leaderboard is displayed. Again, there are two automatically generated buttons which just switch forms. The content of a DB where the leaderboard is stored is loaded into a table and manipulated via an instance of DefaultTableModel, which sorts the leaderboard data.

### Database.java
This class is meant to deal with the game's leaderboard, namely creating one, if it doesn't already exist, saving and loading it, adding new players. Since I am an absolute beginner with DBs, the functionality is very basic.

### GameBoard.java
The game runs in this form. It has access to an instance of GameThread and GameBoard, which are initiated as the form starts. Actions are assigned to hotkeys and score and level are updated using this class's methods.
